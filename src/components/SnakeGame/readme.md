# Snake Readme

Snake game built using HTML Canvas, ReactJS, and MUI. 

Project page -> SnakeGame -> SnakeCanvas -> HTML Canvas and AnimationFrames

SnakeCanvas manages:
- AnimationFrames managed by hook useLayoutEffect(). 
    - Called at top level of component that fires before browser repaints screen. Used to position renderings.
    - If updating state from useLayoutEffect(), all other Effects immediately called
        - We setFrameCounter() if game in session, set snakeState() is game over
        - If game is over, then reset snake by setting default snake in snakeState.
        - TODO: functions and objects defined inside component may also cause re-rendering
        - State update block browser from repainting screen. Can slow app. useEffect() is often prefered. 
    - Watches for changed to state.shouldStart
- Game play and updates managed by hook useEffect().
    - synchronizes component with external system, 
        - like Canvas HTML, setInterval() and clearInterval(), windows.addEventListener()
    - Each cycle runs cleanup and setup code. Everytime dependencies change, Effect runs cleanup, then setup code. On final dismount, run cleaup code again.
